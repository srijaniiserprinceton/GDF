GDF documentation
=================

GDF or Gyrotorpic Distribution Functions are a commonly used approximation for
solar wind velocity distribution functions (VDFs). This repository uses Slepian
basis function based reconstructions to recover distribution functions from
Parker Solar Probe's SPAN-Ai instrument. This repository is an extension of vdfit
which was designed for reconstructing agyritropic MMS and Solar Orbiter VDFs 
to the PSP measurements.
