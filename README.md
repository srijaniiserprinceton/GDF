Welcome to GDF's documentation!
===================================
**GDF** of Gyrotorpic Distribution Functions are a commonly used approximation for solar wind velocity distribution functions (VDFs).
This repository uses Slepian basis function based reconstructions to recover distribution functions from Parker Solar Probe's SPAN-Ai
instrument. This repository is an extension of [vdfit](https://github.com/srijaniiserprinceton/VDF_paper1_ESA) which was designed for 
reconstructing agyritropic *MMS* and *Solar Orbiter* VDFs to the PSP measurements.

>[!NOTE]
>This project is under active development. The next goal is to integrate Solar Probe Cup measurements to jointly constraint the GDF reconstructions.
